/**
 * Engine for executing skill scripts.
 *
 * Implementations of this interface provide different sandboxing strategies
 * for safe script execution. The engine is responsible for:
 * - Validating that the script can be executed
 * - Running the script in an isolated environment
 * - Capturing output and exit codes
 * - Enforcing resource limits (timeouts, memory, etc.)
 *
 * ## Sandboxing Strategies
 *
 * Different implementations may provide varying levels of isolation:
 * - **NoOpExecutionEngine**: Denies all execution (safe default)
 * - **ProcessExecutionEngine**: Runs scripts as subprocesses with OS-level isolation
 * - **DockerExecutionEngine**: Runs scripts in ephemeral containers (strongest isolation)
 * - **GraalVMExecutionEngine**: Uses GraalVM polyglot sandboxing for JS/Python
 *
