/**
 * A persistent sandbox environment that survives across multiple executions.
 *
 * Unlike [DockerExecutor] which creates a fresh container per execution,
 * a SandboxSession maintains a long-lived container where state (installed packages,
 * created files, environment changes) persists between calls.
 *
 * Sessions have identity, lifecycle management (pause/resume), and can be
 * used by any executor that accepts a session reference.
 *
 * ## Example
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * val session = sessionManager.create("my-project", config)
 *
 * // Turn 1: install dependencies
 * session.execute(ExecutionRequest(command = listOf("pip", "install", "numpy")))
 *
 * // Turn 2: numpy is still installed
 * session.execute(ExecutionRequest(command = listOf("python3", "-c", "import numpy; print(numpy.__version__)")))
 *
 * // Pause when idle (container stopped, filesystem preserved)
 * session.pause()
 *
 * // Resume later
 * session.resume()
 *
 * // Destroy when done
 * session.close()
 * ```
