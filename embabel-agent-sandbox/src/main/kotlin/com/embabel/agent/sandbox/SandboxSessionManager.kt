 * Manages the lifecycle of [SandboxSession]s across users and executors.

 * ## Example
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * val manager = DockerSandboxSessionManager()
 *
 * // Create a session
 * val session = manager.create(
 *     label = "feature-42",
 *     config = SandboxConfig(enabled = true, image = "node:20-slim"),
 *     owner = "alice",
 *     ttl = 4.hours,
 * )
 *
 * // Retrieve later
 * val same = manager.get(session.id)
 *
 * // List all of alice's sessions
 * val sessions = manager.list(owner = "alice")
 *
 * // Cleanup expired sessions (call periodically)
 * manager.evictExpired()
 *
 * // Shutdown
 * manager.closeAll()
 * ```
